Type definitions for https://node-tap.org/

TAP still has no official types definitions, so here's our interim solution
to help you write nicely structured tests in Typescript.

To use these typings manually:

* copy `index.d.ts` to the path `typings/tap/index.d.ts` in your project
* add `"typings/tap/index.d.ts"` to the `include` section of your `tsconfig.json`
